    "\n",
    "We want to implement the geometric product of two multivectors in $\\mathbb{G}^n$. For all our concrete examples, we will use $n = 3$, but our implementation can handle general $n$. Remember that computing the geometric product of multivectors written out as a linear combination of orthonormal basis elements is done by FOILing, then using the facts\n",

The function `basis(n)` computes a list of all basis vectors, represented as tuples, e.g., $e_1e_3$ is represented as `(1, 3)`. The basis vector $1$ is represented by the empty tuple `()`. We adopt a convention of ordering the basis vectors witha dictionary ordering. Therefore the product $M_1M_2$ can be represented in coordinates as `[0, 0, -6, -2, -3, -4, 3, 0]`"

    "Now we want to be able to simplify the geometric product of basis elements, i.e., use properties 2, 3, and 4 above to reduce a string of basis vectors. We stick to the convention that we always write a product of basis elements in order, e.g. we would always write $-e_1e_2$ instead of $e_2e_1$. If we only consider multiplying basis vectors, that means the concatenation of two strings of basis multivectors would at most contain two instances of the same vector. That means that up to sign, the product of two basis multivectors consists of exactly the basis vectors that are in the symmetric difference of the two multivectors. This is because if a vector were in both basis multivectors, it would occur exactly once in each basis multivector, and swapping elements would eventually kill that vector; if a vector were in neither basis multivector, it wouldn't occur in the product; and if a vector were in exactly one of the basis multivectors, it would not be killed.\n",

This is probably a stupid method but for small $n$ whatever. \n",
